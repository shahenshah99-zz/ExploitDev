# Vanilla Buffer Overflow

## Exploit Scripting/Development

Exploit scripting refers to the art of writing your own custom exploits in your favourite language and then employing that exploit script to a vulnerable application. and finally compromising it. I consider exploit scripting an art, in your arsenal, because it takes that of you to gain an [RCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution) \(Remote Code Execution\) through a vulnerable system. [DOSing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial_of_Service_attack) \(Denial Of Service\) and crash the system is any script kiddie's job.

## Target Audience

I personally believe that this book will be helpful for everyone interested in understanding the true art of pen-testing and breaking things. But in a more confined and obvious manner. This will be helpful for people preparing for OSCP/OSCE and AWE \(Advanced Windows Exploitation\) examination by Offensive Security, or to people preparing or currently enrolled in any such course. This book will take you from beginners to a master in writing your own scripts and in utilising Windows APIs to gain your own reverse shell. Without using any metasploit-generated Payload. 

## What to Expect from this book

By the end of this book you would understand the art of exploitation and will be able to write your own custom made scripts to exploit machines vulnerable to Buffer Overflow. This will also make your understanding of the way metasploit exploit scripts work, quite strong. You would also be able to detect such vulnerabilities.

## What not to expect from this book

So this is not a reverse engineering book. We would be going through a crash course in python but don't expect a detailed study in Python.

## Prerequisites

This course has been designed for any beginner level pen-tester to understand and implement.
