# Setting Up Your Lab

## Installing the Machines

The machines and the setup files that would be required to reproduce the attacks listed in the book would be -  

* **Windows XP Service Pack 3**: Now windows has stopped the distribution of XP. So the installation of this machine is left to the discretion of the user.
* **Attacking Machine**: I have been using Parrot Security as my attacking machine to craft the exploit and deliver it to the target machine. You may download the latest copy of the attacking machine
