# Into to Exploit Development

## What is a Buffer?

In our case, by the term buffer we mean a space in memory to store some value that was taken as a user input, or has been utilised by the program buffer for temporary reasons. In layman's terms, buffer only refers to a space in memory used by the program to feed in data and then later retrieve it to manipulate or to use it for some other purpose.

### So what is overflowing the buffer?

You, silly :\) . So basically, A developer creates a code which takes user input. Now, that user input, if not validated inside the program, can cause chaos. It is the responsibility of the developer to consider anything as the user input. Now, in a buffer if there is an array of size 5, i.e. the array is designed to input 5 characters from the users. Now an insecure way of taking the input from the user would be - 

```text
InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
int a[] = new int[5];
for(int i = 0; i <= 1000; i++)
    a[i] = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
```

Whereas a proper way of taking user input would be - 

```text
InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
int a[] = new int[5];
for(int i = 0; i <= 4; i++)
    a[i] = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
```

Now, I don't believe that there is any need for specific explanation to implore the difference between the above given pieces of code, but lets get an overlook of the above depicted code - 

In the first example the code has a buffer of 5 characters and the developer is still accepting 1000 characters. Now you'd be asking yourself; Who would do something like this. Well, the developers won't implement something exactly as the aforementioned code but then that would be a result of an overlooked coding to a software / service.Moreover, this specific implementation for purposely shown in crystal manner in java to depict the change, but then in certain implementation of code, user validation is given the least importance. Hence this leads to a buffer overflow, which would also be flagged to something known as [segmentation fault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_fault). The other example, whereas, is not vulnerable to buffer overflow, since the bounds of the buffer are checked and the user has no option to enter characters more than required.
